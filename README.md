PerkManager

The User can create a Profile with all the memberships and cards she has: 

Air Miles, CAA, credit card etc. A "Perk" is some kind of discount for a 

given membership and a given product: 10% off movies with a Visa card, free 

domestic flight with 10,000 Air Miles, etc. Perks may also have limitations 

in geographic area and in time. These perks can be posted anytime by any 

user (the user may first need to enter the product or membership for which 

the perk applies). Users can upvote or downvote these perks depending on 

whether they find them useful or incorrect. Search results for perks can be 

listed in decreasing amount of votes, or by expiry date. Logged-in users 

can search for products for which there are perks available matching their 

profile. A user without a profile (or not logged-in) can still search for 

perks, but won't get the benefit of finding matches for their memberships.
